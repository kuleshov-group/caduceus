# Caduceus &#9764;: Bi-Directional Equivariant Long-Range DNA Sequence Modeling
[[Blog]](https://caduceus-dna.github.io/) &nbsp; | &nbsp; [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03234) &nbsp; | &nbsp; [[HuggingFace ðŸ¤—]](https://huggingface.co/collections/kuleshov-group/caducues-65dcb89b4f54e416ef61c350)

This repository contains code for reproducing the results in the paper "Caduceus: Bi-Directional Equivariant Long-Range DNA Sequence Modeling," [Schiff et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03234).

## Using Caduceus with ðŸ¤—
<a name="HF"></a>
We have uploaded a pre-trained Caduceus model to the Huggingface hub.
The available models are:
- Caduceus-Ph: [kuleshov-group/caduceus-ph_seqlen-131k_d_model-256_n_layer-16](https://huggingface.co/kuleshov-group/caduceus-ph_seqlen-131k_d_model-256_n_layer-16)
  - Trained on sequences of length 131k, with a model size of 256 and 16 layers.
  - Trained for 50k steps and batch size of 8.
  - Trained with reverse-complement (RC) data augmentation.
- Caduceus-PS: [kuleshov-group/caduceus-ps_seqlen-131k_d_model-256_n_layer-16](https://huggingface.co/kuleshov-group/caduceus-ps_seqlen-131k_d_model-256_n_layer-16)
  - Trained on sequences of length 131k, with a model size of 256 and 16 layers.
  - Trained for 50k steps and batch size of 8.
  - Model is RC equivariant, hence no RC data augmentation is required.

You can either use the pre-trained model directly within your trainer scripts or modify the config that initializes the model.

To use the pre-trained model for masked language modeling, use the following snippet:
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForMaskedLM, AutoTokenizer

# See the `Caduceus` collection page on the hub for list of available models.
model_name = "kuleshov-group/caduceus-ph_seqlen-131k_d_model-256_n_layer-16"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

Alternatively, you can instantiate a model from scratch to train on your own data as follows:
```python
from transformers import AutoConfig, AutoModelForMaskedLM

# Add any config overrides here, see the `config.json` file on the hub for details.
config_overrides = {}
# See the `Caduceus` collection page on the hub for list of available models.
config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(
 "kuleshov-group/caduceus-ph_seqlen-131k_d_model-256_n_layer-16",
 **config_overrides,
)
model = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_config(config)
```

## Getting started in this repository
<a name="getting_started"></a>

To get started, create a conda environment containing the required dependencies.

```bash
conda env create -f caduceus_env.yml
```

Activate the environment.

```bash
conda activate caduceus_env
```

Create the following directories to store saved models and slurm logs:
```bash
mkdir outputs
mkdir watch_folder
```

## Reproducing Experiments

Below, we describe the steps required for reproducing the experiments in the paper.
Throughout, the main entry point for running experiments is the [`train.py`](./train.py) script.
We also provide sample `slurm` scripts for launching pre-training and downstream fine-tuning experiments in the [`slurm_scripts/`](./slurm_scripts) directory.

### Pretraining on Human Reference Genome
<a name="pretraining"></a>
(Data downloading instructions are copied from [HyenaDNA repo](https://github.com/HazyResearch/hyena-dna?tab=readme-ov-file#pretraining-on-human-reference-genome))

First, download the Human Reference Genome data.
It's comprised of 2 files, 1 with all the sequences (the `.fasta` file), and with the intervals we use (`.bed` file).

The file structure should look like

```
data
|-- hg38/
    |-- hg38.ml.fa
    |-- human-sequences.bed
```

Download fasta (.fa format) file (of the entire human genome) into `./data/hg38`.
~24 chromosomes in the whole genome (merged into 1 file), each chromosome is a continuous sequence, basically.
Then download the .bed file with sequence intervals (contains chromosome name, start, end, split, which then allow you to retrieve from the fasta file).
```bash
mkdir -p data/hg38/
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/basenji_barnyard2/hg38.ml.fa.gz > data/hg38/hg38.ml.fa.gz
gunzip data/hg38/hg38.ml.fa.gz  # unzip the fasta file
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/basenji_barnyard2/sequences_human.bed > data/hg38/human-sequences.bed
```

Launch pretraining run using the command line

```bash
python -m train \
  experiment=hg38/hg38 \
  callbacks.model_checkpoint_every_n_steps.every_n_train_steps=500 \
  dataset.max_length=1024 \
  dataset.batch_size=1024 \
  dataset.mlm=true \
  dataset.mlm_probability=0.15 \
  dataset.rc_aug=false \
  model=caduceus \
  model.config.d_model=128 \
  model.config.n_layer=4 \
  model.config.bidirectional=true \
  model.config.bidirectional_strategy=add \
  model.config.bidirectional_weight_tie=true \
  model.config.rcps=true \
  optimizer.lr="8e-3" \
  train.global_batch_size=1024 \
  trainer.max_steps=10000 \
  +trainer.val_check_interval=10000 \
  wandb=null
```

or alternatively, if using a cluster that has `slurm` installed, adapt the scripts below:
```
slurm_scripts
|-- run_pretrain_caduceus.sh
|-- run_pretrain_hyena.sh
|-- run_pretrain_mamba.sh
```

and run the training as a batch job:
```bash
cd slurm_scripts
sbatch run_pretrain_caduceus.sh
```

### GenomicBenchmarks
<a name="genomicbenchmarks"></a>

The [GenomicBenchmarks](https://github.com/ML-Bioinfo-CEITEC/genomic_benchmarks) presented in [GreÅ¡ovÃ¡ et al. (2023)](https://bmcgenomdata.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12863-023-01123-8) is comprised of 8 classification tasks.

We can launch a downstream fine-tuning run on one of the tasks using the sample command below:
```bash
python -m train \
    experiment=hg38/genomic_benchmark \
    callbacks.model_checkpoint_every_n_steps.every_n_train_steps=5000 \
    dataset.dataset_name="dummy_mouse_enhancers_ensembl" \
    dataset.train_val_split_seed=1 \
    dataset.batch_size=256 \
    dataset.rc_aug=false \
    +dataset.conjoin_train=false \
    +dataset.conjoin_test=false \
    loader.num_workers=2 \
    model=caduceus \
    model._name_=dna_embedding_caduceus \
    +model.config_path="<path to model_config.json>" \
    +model.conjoin_test=false \
    +decoder.conjoin_train=true \
    +decoder.conjoin_test=false \
    optimizer.lr="1e-3" \
    trainer.max_epochs=10 \
    train.pretrained_model_path="<path to .ckpt file>" \
    wandb=null
```

This sample run will fine-tune a pre-trained Caduceus-PS model on the `dummy_mouse_enhancers_ensembl` task.
Note some of the additional arguments present here, relative to the pre-training command from [above](#pretraining):
- `model.config_path` contains the path model config that was saved during pre-training.
This will be saved to the run directory of the pre-training experiment.
- `train.pretrained_model_path` contains the path to the pre-trained model checkpoint.
- `dataset.conjoin_train` determines whether the dataset will return a single sequence (`dataset.conjoin_train=false`) or the concatenation of a sequence and its reverse complement along `dim=-1`, during downstream fine-tuning training.
- `dataset.conjoin_test` is the same as above, but for inference (e.g., validation / test).
- `decoder.conjoin_train` determines whether the prediction head (a mean pooling and linear projection in the case of the Genomics Benchmark) is expecting an input tensor of shape `(batch_size, seq_len, d_model)` or `(batch_size, seq_len, d_model, 2)` during downstream fine-tuning training.
When set to `true` the decoder is run on `input[..., 0]` and `input[..., 1]` and the results are averaged to produce the final prediction.
- `decoder.conjoin_test` is the same as above, but for inference (e.g., validation / test).

Note this benchmark only contains a training and test split for each task.
Therefore, to have a more principled evaluation, we randomly split the training data into training and validation sets (90/10) using the `dataset.train_val_split_seed` argument.
We perform early stopping on validation metric (accuracy) and repeat this for 5 random seeds.

As with [pre-training](#pretraining), we can also launch the fine-tuning run as a batch job using the provided [`run_genomic_benchmark.sh`](./slurm_scripts/run_genomics_benchmark.sh) script.
We also provide a helper shell script [`wrapper_run_genomics.sh`](./slurm_scripts/wrapper_run_genomics.sh) that can be used to launch multiple fine-tuning runs in parallel.

Finally, the [`run_genomics_benchmark_cnn.sh`](./slurm_scripts/run_genomics_benchmark_cnn.sh) script can be used to train the CNN baseline for this experiment from scratch on the downstream tasks.

### Nucleotide Transformer datasets
<a name="nucleotidetransformer"></a>

The Nucleotide Transformer suite of tasks was proposed in [Dalla-Torre et al. (2023)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.11.523679v1).
The data is available on HuggingFace: [InstaDeepAI/nucleotide_transformer_downstream_tasks](https://huggingface.co/datasets/InstaDeepAI/nucleotide_transformer_downstream_tasks).

We can launch a downstream fine-tuning run on one of the tasks using the sample command below:
```bash
python -m train \
    experiment=hg38/nucleotide_transformer \
    callbacks.model_checkpoint_every_n_steps.every_n_train_steps=5000 \
    dataset.dataset_name="${task}" \
    dataset.train_val_split_seed=${seed} \
    dataset.batch_size=${batch_size} \
    dataset.rc_aug="${rc_aug}" \
    +dataset.conjoin_test="${CONJOIN_TEST}" \
    loader.num_workers=2 \
    model._name_=dna_embedding_caduceus \
    +model.config_path="<path to model_config.json>" \
    +model.conjoin_test=false \
    +decoder.conjoin_train=true \
    +decoder.conjoin_test=false \
    optimizer.lr="1e-3" \
    trainer.max_epochs=10 \
    train.pretrained_model_path="<path to .ckpt file>" \
    trainer.max_epochs=20 \
    wandb=null
```

We can also launch as batch jobs (see [`run_nucleotide_transformer.sh`](./slurm_scripts/run_nucleotide_transformer.sh) and [`wrapper_run_nucleotide_transformer.sh`](./slurm_scripts/wrapper_run_nucleotide_transformer.sh) for details).

### eQTL SNP Variant Effect Prediction
<a name="vep"></a>
This task comes from the recently proposed Long Range Benchmark (LRB) in [Kao et al., 2023](https://llms4science-community.github.io/papers/LLMs4Bio24_paper_12.pdf).
The data is available on HuggingFace: [InstaDeepAI/genomics-long-range-benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/InstaDeepAI/genomics-long-range-benchmark).
For this task we fit a model to the pre-trained and frozen embeddings of the DNA language models.
Therefore, to perform the evaluation, we proceed in 2 steps:
- **Step 1: Extract the embeddings** from the pre-trained model:
Run the [`vep_embeddings.py`](./vep_embeddings.py) script to extract the embeddings from the pre-trained model.
See the example below:
```bash
torchrun \
    --standalone \
    --nnodes=1 \
    --nproc-per-node=8 \
    vep_embeddings.py \
      --num_workers=2 \
      --seq_len=131072  \
      --bp_per_token=1  \
      --embed_dump_batch_size=1 \
      --name="caduceus-ps_downstream-seqlen=131k"  \
      --model_name_or_path="kuleshov-group/caduceus-ps_seqlen-131k_d_model-256_n_layer-16" \
      --rcps
```

The `--rcps` flag is used to indicate that the model is reverse-complement equivariant.
When using other models, set this flag to false with `--no-rcps`.
To speed this step up, this script utilizes torch distributed data parallelism.

Please refer to the slurm script provided in [`slurm_scripts/dump_vep_embeddings.sh`](./slurm_scripts/dump_vep_embeddings.sh)
to launch this step as a batch job.

- **Step 2: Fit an SVM model to the embeddings** using this notebook: [`vep_svm.ipynb`](./vep_svm.ipynb).
